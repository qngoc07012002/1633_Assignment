				<h3>Shipping Policy</h3>
                
                <p>
                We ship to anywhere in the world serviced by major shippers like <strong>DHL, TNT, UPS</strong> and <strong>EMS</strong>. It is the customers liability to check whether the items they intend to order have any import restrictions by their customs before they place order.</p>

            <h3>Payment Policy</h3>
              <p>We prefer paypal or credit/debit card through paypal for order not exceeding $5000. All paypal payments must be made in U.S Dollars. Payment not received in other currency. You can still opt to pay by paypal for order exceeding $5000, but we would have to levy a 3.5% surcharge.</p>
